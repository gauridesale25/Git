Built a mini version of Git in JavaScript, implementing core version control features like initializing .git directories
to manage project histories.
• It uses custom commands like init, commit, cat-file, add, log, and status to manage project snapshots, stage
changes, track commit logs, and check the repository’s state.
• Developed functionality to create and read blob objects, simulating file storage and content tracking within the
version control system.
